IO-X3 Change log

2020-11-11
	first set of firmware for IO-X3
	PCIe endpoint and memory system working

2020-11-18
	working:
		4x SDI input
		4x SDI output
		4x frame buffer
		4xCSC
		4xLUT
		4x Dual Link In
		4x Dual link out
		genlock
	not included:
		HDMI input
		HDMI output
		all IO other than SDI
	issues:
		Sometimes the SDI transmitters need to be kicked to get them working by switching back and forth between 50 and 59.94 frame rates in the watcher.  
		Audio is all hooked up but not working, I think we aren't pointing to the same address space.

    Everything functional (with rework tackies) on the -R0 board
    
2021-02-05
    analog audio in working by enabled AXIS audio in audio engines (needs -R1 board or tacky on -R0 boards to connect ADC I2C lines)
    correct sense of analog audio direction controls
    power LED working with new scheme for displaying Tbt connectivity (needs -R1 LED board or reworked -R0)
    slow driver rate to audio ADC to work with evaluation board tacked onto main PCB
    force analog audio DAC into oversampling mode to reduce spurious noise and slightly decrease noise floor
    
2021-02-16
    Update project for -R1 board
    Moved SDI transceivers to different bank to allow tandem boot to function
    re-ordered SDI ports
    no debug ila or vio, no timing errors
    
2021-03-18
    Corrected bug with SDI 3G level B
    no debug ila or vio, no timing errors
