   The microphone level pot adjusts the input gain from minus infinity to +6 dB.
   The three way slide switch adjusts the full scale max input from +24dBu for line to -6dBu for Mic and +48.
   The headphone jack and headphone volume work, and the level meters do their flashing.
   Verified the mic function by putting the device in loop through in the control panel,
   and then manually overriding the audio input control register to select the microphone port.
   Audio was then routed back out to the headphone jack and I could hear it without any noticeable noise.
   That demonstrated that the mic audio is making into the audio engine correctly.
