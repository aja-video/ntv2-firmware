# NTV2 Firmware

## Overview 
This is where you can find firmware files for AJA Video's NTV2-based devices.

Each device or model has its own folder that contains the bitfiles for flashing to said device. 

Some devices have changelog text files and others do not. It's our goal to get a changelog file for all devices in the near future(tm).

This repo will be updated with every MAJOR point release for [libajantv2](https://github.com/aja-video/libajantv2) / [NTV2 SDK](https://sdksupport.aja.com/).

**This Repo is intended for advanced users and OEM use only if you are a standard retail user please update you device through our [ControlPanel](https://www.aja.com/products/aja-control-room) application!**

If you are a developer looking to get started with our products, consider enrolling in our [developer program](https://www.aja.com/developer/request).
