IO4K Plus Change log

01/09/2020
CPLD bitfile T3Tap_cfg_spi4x.jed supports 
    reads from SPI flash in x4 mode
    Program FPGA in x8 mode (400mS from power up to FPGA done)
    does not support tandem boot because that is not currently in the main FPGA
FPGA bitfile T3_Tap.bit supports
    PCIe G3 x 4 endpoint
	PCI device ID = EB26
	Board Type = 108790000
	2 DMA Read Channel
	2 DMA Write Channel
	1 GByte DDR
	SDI 1 out
	1 8K frame buffer
	1 4K CSC
	2 Audio Engines
	1 Quad link audio embedder
	1 Dual Link output module
	1 Quad Anc Inserter
	1 Video Lut (that isn't hooked up correctly right now)
    
04/21/2020      
    FPGA now works in all HDMI output formats from 525i to 4Kx2160p60
    Embedded audio output working and plays out a test clip in 1920x1080p59.94 with embedded audio from ControlRoom
    
05/28/2020
	HDMI audio working
	headphone audio working
	rotary encoder count can be read back by SW
	LED bar graph works
	power LED indicates link status

06/18/2020
	PCI tandem boot works with new CPLD, PCIe endpoint is ready 30mS after rising edge of PCIE_RESET#

07/02/2020
	Add audio mixer capable bit set to 1
	corresponds to top level checkin #1499

07/08/2020
	update CPLD to load FPGA at power on, but requires change to reset timer cap to prevent errors with safeboot selection
	Update FPGA to correct rotary encoder readback, preventing multiple increments when rotating knob by single detents

07/14/2020
	Added output gain stage to audio mixer for rotary encoder override
09/14/2020
	Updated to work with -R2 board
	HDMI now uses FPGA internal IP
	HDMI and SDI outputs working for majority of formats (no SD, no UHD/4K psf)
9/17/2020
	Embedded audio on SDI working
9/18/2020
	525 and 625 SDI work, still not working for HDMI
9/23/2020
	625 HDMI working, 525 almost working
9/27/2020
	525 and 625 working on SDI and HDMI
9/29/2020
	Corrected UHD output in RGB format
10/3/2020
	Audio clock now locks to video reference clock, previously always locked to 148.5MHz regaurdless of video rate
10/6/2020
	Checkin on 9/29 actually broke UHD SDI in all formats, now corrected.
10/12/2020
	Changed audio interrupts to be driven by second audio engine
10/12/2020
	Increase memory transaction speed to fix issues with playback at 4K60 using FCP
10/26/2020
	Make left and right output gain in the mixer module affect the output of all channels
10/27/2020
	add AES crosspoint in path to headphone output so that audio engine 1, engine 2, or mixer output can be routed to the headphones
11/04/2020
	create 12.288MHz audio clock which is locked to master video clock internally to FPGA to remove EOL PLL from BOM
01/08/2021
    correct some of the clock muxing that I did wrong in the last checkin, fixed HDMI SD outputs and numerous audio glitches
02/21/2021
    add connection to xpt so that LUT output can route to HDMI transmitter input
03/03/2021
    Jeff L's 12bit HDMI fix
    add sixteen channel audio output level monitoring to audio mixer
08/11/2021    
    swap left and right channels going to the front LED display, they were reversed previously.
